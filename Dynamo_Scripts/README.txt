__________ GUIDE TO DYNAMO SCRIPTS __________

--FOURIER SHELL CORRELATION--
1. FSC_Interval.m --> Run an FSC from an alignment project at an interval of every n particles. This can help determine if more particles will or will not help improve resolution

2. FSC_CCInterval.m --> Run an FSC from an alignment project at an interval of every n particles, ordered by cross correlation (column 10 in the Dynamo table). When run at an smaller interval number, can help you determine which particles aren't contributing much to the average (i.e. are making resolution worse)

3. FSC_Interval_initAverage.m --> If you have an average that was computed from the MatLab command line (for example, using daverage() and therefore not from an alignment project), compute the FSC of half sets that created this average

4. dfsc2XML.m --> Convert the FSC results to an XML file that can be deposited to the EMDB with your maps4. dfsc2XML.m --> Convert the FSC results to an XML file that can be deposited to the EMDB with your maps4. dfsc2XML.m --> Convert the FSC results to an XML file that can be deposited to the EMDB with your maps4. dfsc2XML.m --> Convert the FSC results to an XML file that can be deposited to the EMDB with your maps

--IMPORTING PARTICLES FROM IMOD--
1. CreateGeneral.m --> Import particles as they're picked (no orientations will be imparted on these particles). Each tomogram's model must be imported 1 at a time

2. createGeneralBatch.m --> Import particles as they're picked (no orientations will be imparted on these particles). Can import from multiple tomograms at once. Requirements are in the script's header

3. createFilTorsion.m --> Import particles of a filament as a "filamentWithTorsion" model. Particles will be oriented so that each particle's rotational axis (Z in Dynamo, Y in PEET) is the rotational axis of the filament. Each filament must be saved as a different .mod file. Each tomogrm's models must be imported 1 at a time

4. slicer2DynamoEuler.m --> If you have slicer angles saved for particle orientations in IMOD, import these angles and apply them to your particles in Dynamo. Instructions and requirements in the header of this script. 
4a and 4b. natsort.m and natsortfiles.m --> These go along with slicer2DynamoEuler.m Use only as instructred in the header of slicer2DynamoEuler.m

--ALIGNING SUBVOLUMES--
***NOTE*** There are two versions of each of these scripts. One (ends in PEET1_13) should only be used if you're running PEET v1.13.0. The other (ends in PEET1_15) should be used if you are running PEET 1.15.1. Currently unsure which should be run for PEET 1.14.x. For some reason, the PEET command "MOTL2slicer" changed the convention of input angles

1. createAlignedParticles.m --> From a Dynamo subtomogram alignment run, create a set of align particles. This involves using 'rotatevol' on each particle using the angles from the final refined table

2. dtable2csv.m --> Orients a subtomogram average into the position of angle of each aligned particle. Following this script, one should use the IMOD commands "imodauto" to generate an envelope of the subtomogram average, and "clonemodel" to generate models that have the subtomogram average placed at each particle's aligned position

--MOVING FROM DYNAMO TO PEET--
1. d2prm.m --> Use if you want to convert a finished Dynamo alignment/averaging project into a parameter file (.prm) for PEET. This prm can be used to start a project and perform a zero search average to create necessary files that can be used for other PEET programs, such as varianceMap and calcFSC.

--Generating Figures--
dtplot_particleOrientation.m --> Plots the orientation of each particle used to generate the final average from the final refined table to view paritcle orientations per tomogram. Instructions and requirements are in the header of this script. Briefly, you must have a Dynamo results directory generated by a dynamo run.
